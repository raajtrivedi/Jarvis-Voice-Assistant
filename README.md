# **Jarvis-Voice-Assistant**
Jarvis is a simple, speech-enabled virtual assistant built with Python that responds to voice commands to open websites, play music, and read out the latest news headlines. Inspired by the fictional assistant from Iron Man, this project demonstrates the use of speech recognition, text-to-speech, and web integration using Python libraries.

## **🧠 How It Works :**
 - Jarvis waits for the wake word "Jarvis" using your system's microphone.
 - Once activated, it listens for a follow-up command like:
     - "Open Google"
     - "Play believer"
     - "News"
- Based on the command, it opens web pages, plays songs from your music library, or fetches and reads out top news headlines.
- Uses text-to-speech (TTS) to give vocal confirmations and output.
