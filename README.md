# Jarvis-Voice-Assistant
Jarvis is a simple, speech-enabled virtual assistant built with Python that responds to voice commands to open websites, play music, and read out the latest news headlines. Inspired by the fictional assistant from Iron Man, this project demonstrates the use of speech recognition, text-to-speech, and web integration using Python libraries.
